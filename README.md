# sata 3.3v injector
I came across these sata 16GB drives that I could not read or write to with a standard USB to ATA adaptor. (similar drive pictured below)

Apparently both the 5v and 3.3v supplies were required to achive this. So I thought I would design my adaptor to solve this issue.

A voltage regualtor to drop the 5v rail down to 3.3v would be an easy solution.
